abstract: "Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a brain-inspired computational paradigm that exploits the natural dynamics of a quantum system for information processing. To date, a multitude of quantum systems have been utilized in QRC, with diverse computational capabilities demonstrated accordingly. This study proposes a reciprocal research direction: Probing quantum systems themselves through their information processing performance in the QRC framework. Building upon this concept, here we develop quantum reservoir probing (QRP), an inverse extension of the QRC. The QRP establishes an operator-level linkage between physical properties and computational performance. A systematic scan of this correspondence reveals the intrinsic quantum dynamics of the reservoir system from both computational and informational perspectives. Unifying quantum information and quantum matter, the QRP holds great promise as a potent tool for exploring various aspects of quantum many-body physics. In this study, we specifically apply it to analyze information propagation in a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We demonstrate that the QRP not only distinguishes between ballistic and diffusive information propagation, reflecting the system's dynamical characteristics, but also identifies system-specific information propagation channels, a distinct advantage over conventional methods."
